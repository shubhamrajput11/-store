# -store
this a flask basic application for store.
after learrning basics of flask and using different inbuilt function I try to use them in this program.

## Installattion
 Basically i have created a virtual enviorment name Flask.
 Install flask inside it - Pip install flask.
 I have also intsalled platformio-ide-terminal script in a Atom to use terminal inside atom only 
   (if you are having problem in using Atom then try sublime text for good indentation and simplicity)
 
## Description
 
 this program is written using flask,python language
 Some end points-
               1.('/')
               2.('/store) to acess the store
               3.('/store/<string:name>)  where string_name is store name.
               4.('/store/<string:name>/item: , price)  store name and its item with price)
 
 i have used port 5567 it is not mendatory you can use by default 5000 i have just written it randomly
 
 I have used Atom to write this code and miniconda for setting the python path in windows(used windows 7 as my machine requirement).
 Used Postman application to run the api or to check out the result of GET and POST command.
 It also includes HTML and JavaScript file which calls the Flask app endpoints.
 
 ## Important
 
 Please create the virtual enviorment before doing command line work install all the packages inside it because during updation
 you may see slight changes in a pakages or anything related to the pakages,inbuilt functions,methodes etc. and it will allow you to work   in a particular enviorment rather than working on root directory.Working on root directory may harm our machine and changes the setting.
 
 ENJOY!
